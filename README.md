# Gist Good
*Organize and search your authored and starred gists.*

## rails stuff
This project is made with **ruby 2.5** and **rails 5.2**. Will use devise to integrate with the github login api (*for more go to the [#1 issue](https://github.com/graciano/gist-good/issues/1)*). Database creation and configuration is the default for the current rails version, please refer to the [rails guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/). Eventually I'll add [rspec](http://rspec.info/documentation/) for testing.
